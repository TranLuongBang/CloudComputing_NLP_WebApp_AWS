# Cloud Computing - NLP Web Application deployed on AWS

### Introduction
In this project, we are going to work on Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning Algorithms.
We are going to build a website which allows users to classify a positive or negative comment. This
web application will be deployed on AWS cloud platform.

We will also measure the performance and the scalability of webserver by
sending multiple requests to our server

### Training Model for Sentiment Analysis

To train model we have used kaggle_dataset, In this dataset there are 1.6 million tweets.

While training with Bert architecture we got around 84% accuracy.

Data: https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140
